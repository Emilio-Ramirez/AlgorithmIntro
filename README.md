## Hierarchy Explanation

The repository follows a 4-level hierarchy:

1. **Main Topic** : The root of our DSA practice
2. **Categories** : Major algorithm/data structure domains
3. **Subcategories** : Specific problem types or implementation areas
4. **Exercises** : Individual problems and their solutions
