# AlgorithmIntro

This repository contains implementations and exercises for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics. The structure follows a clear hierarchy explained below.


## Hierarchy Explanation

The repository follows a 4-level hierarchy:

1. **Main Topic** : The root of our DSA practice
2. **Categories** : Major algorithm/data structure domains
3. **Subcategories** : Specific problem types or implementation areas
4. **Exercises** : Individual problems and their solutions


## Technology Stack

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black" />

All solutions are implemented in JavaScript, focusing on:

- Clean, readable code
- Detailed comments explaining the logic
- Multiple approaches when applicable
- Time and space complexity analysis

## Learning Progress

This repository represents my ongoing journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. The learning process follows:

1. **Understanding the Concept**

   - Study the theoretical foundation
   - Analyze time and space complexities
   - Research common patterns and use cases

2. **Implementation Practice**

   - Solve problems incrementally
   - Start with brute force solutions
   - Optimize and refine approaches
   - Document learning insights

3. **Review and Improvement**
   - Regular revision of completed problems
   - Pattern recognition across similar problems
   - Continuous optimization of solutions
